There is a large setup violation of -20.663 ns between your_instance_name/U0/stn_16bit_struct/subsystem/subsystem/shift1/op_mem_46_20_reg[0][15]_replica/C (clocked by CLK) and your_instance_name/U0/stn_16bit_struct/subsystem/subsystem/cordic_6_0/stn_16bit_cordic_v6_0_i0_instance/U0/i_synth/i_synth/gen_cordic.output_stage/gen_rotation.gen_rotate.gen_data_x_addsub/m_axis_dout_tdata[27]_INST_0_psdsp/D (clocked by CLK). Large setup violations at the end of those stages might be difficult to fix during the post-placement implementation flow and could be the result of non-optimal XDC constraints or non-optimal design architecture
