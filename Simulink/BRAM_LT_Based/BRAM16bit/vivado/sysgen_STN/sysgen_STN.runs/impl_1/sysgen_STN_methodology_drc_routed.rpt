TIMING-16#32 Warning
Large setup violation  
There is a large setup violation of -1.205 ns between your_instance_name/U0/bram_stn_16bit_struct/subsystem/subsystem/bram_cordic/imag/xpm_memory_sprom_inst/xpm_memory_base_inst/gen_rd_a.douta_reg_reg/CLKARDCLK (clocked by CLK) and your_instance_name/U0/bram_stn_16bit_struct/subsystem/subsystem/bram_cordic/register_x0/synth_reg_inst/latency_gt_0.fd_array[1].reg_comp/fd_prim_array[9].bit_is_0.fdre_comp/D (clocked by CLK). Large setup violations at the end of those stages might be difficult to fix during the post-placement implementation flow and could be the result of non-optimal XDC constraints or non-optimal design architecture
