Complex Exponential Neuron Implementation on FPGA

In the spiking neural networks, the firing patterns are the summation of oscillating futures of the interconnected neurons. The oscillating features such as frequency, amplitude, and phase shift can easily be encoded by the complex exponential form. The simple phase addition of complex exponential function simplifies the intensive amount of calculation that is required in conventional artificial neural networks.
